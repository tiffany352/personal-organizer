# Typescript App Template

This is a template I put together myself for an app I was making. It might not
be very good, use at your own risk.

The basic idea was that I wanted to use Typescript on both the frontend and
backend, working from the repo, without having to have two separate code editors
open running two different devserver watch tasks. This seems to satisfy that
pretty well.

The example app is built around a quote viewer that fetches one of ten random
quotes using a simple API endpoint. It demonstrates that React, Redux,
Redux-Thunk, React-Redux, HTTP requests, webserver (Koa), etc. are all working
in tandem.
